# CareTracker : Passive Child Tracking System Using NFC Technology
#### CareTracker is a passive children tracking system. Here the child will wear the tracking band like a bracelet which will be provided with NFC tag and QR code.This band will be made up of polyester and dyneema material.

#### Children's safety is a major concern in today’s world. Children are very curious and innocent and thus they most likely don't recognize good people and bad people and they become subject to kidnapping. Parents are worried about their child's whereabouts and their safety in public places. Many applications are being developed for this reason. But all of the applications use electronic devices and circuits which can be harmful to the child. We are proposing CareTracker - a safety band for children which will provide passive tracking of the child. This will help the parents worry less and do their work without trouble. In our system, we are proposing less usage of electronic devices and circuits. This will be helpful for schools to allow bands in school. In our band, there will be an NFC tag on a Polyester and Dyneema band, which will contain information about the parent. When a finder person finds the child, they can get the information of the parents of the missing child using their mobile phones.

### What is NFC?
##### NFC stands for Near Field Communication. It is a wireless communication technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other when they are in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters. NFC is based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which allows two-way communication between devices.

##### NFC technology is widely used for contactless payments, where a smartphone or other mobile device is used to make payments by simply tapping it on a point-of-sale terminal. It is also used for a variety of other applications, such as data transfer, access control, and ticketing.
##### NFC is a secure and convenient technology that is built into many modern smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports data transfer rates of up to 424 kbps.
#### NFC Security algorithm
##### The data can be a text file or an image that is transferred via NFC and is selected and encrypted. The encryption process is carried out on the data using a public key generated by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the same key is again encrypted using the public key generated by the RSA. The transfer of data takes place between two NFC devices immediately as the phones are tapped with each other. The other NFC device receives the data and stores it in the device folder. The data can be accessed by the application and then decrypted in the reverse process of encryption i.e. it decrypts the key and obtains the AES key and then using that key it decrypts the encrypted data and obtains original data in the same format as it was sent by the receiver. Now, if the data received by the receiver device is malicious, the application won’t decrypt the data. This can be verified by installing a malicious application in the sender’s device and sending malicious data to the receiver’s end. The other architecture includes Diffie-Hellman Key Negotiation Algorithm which is a method that lets two parties communicate over an insecure channel (in our case NFC) to agree upon a random number only known to them. Though during the execution of the Diffie-Hellman key negotiation algorithm, the parties exchange information over the insecure channel, it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to deduce the random number they agree upon by analyzing their network communications. A prime number p and primitive element g are selected by both the sender and receiver. The sender chooses a secret key ‘a’ and computes A as A = ga mod p. Similarly, the receiver chooses a secret key ‘b’ and computes B as B = gB mod p. Both A and B are exchanged. Both the sender and receiver compute the shared key as
##### Sender: k = Ba mod p
##### Receiver k = Ab mod p

### Architecture
#### A. Finder Person-Side System Architecture:

##### CareTracker helps us to find missing children. It uses NFC to enable communication between the system and the finder person's cell phone. If a person finds a missing child, the finder person will scan the NFC tag integrated with the safety band worn by the child. As a finder person scans an NFC tag he will get a link on his screen, after clicking it he will be redirected to the CareTracker's web UI and he will be asked to allow his device's location and now he can see the child's information. The finder person can directly contact the parent through the phone call if he wanted to. The real-time location of the finder person will be shared with the respective parent through the web server.

#### B. Parent-side System Architecture

##### Parents who want to register their children can visit CareTracker's website. At first, they have to sign up on the website with the correct information then they can create a QR code for their children with help of QR-Monkey API. Parents can update and upload their child's information whenever they want, and this updated and uploaded information will be stored in the children’s database.
